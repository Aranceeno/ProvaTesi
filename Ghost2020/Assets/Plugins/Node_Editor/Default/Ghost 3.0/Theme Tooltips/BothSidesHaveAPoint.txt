The world isn't black and white, most of the time there isn't a big bad villain to fight. When in a conflict both sides have a point, the choice of who "is right" and who "is wrong" can be a hard one, if it can be made, and compromise between the two parties can be even harder to find. Sometimes the acceptance of a grey morality alone can be considered a theme. http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint
