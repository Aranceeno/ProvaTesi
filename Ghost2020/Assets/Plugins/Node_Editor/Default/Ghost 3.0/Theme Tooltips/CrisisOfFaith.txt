Religion is questioned in this theme - it can be a discussion over a particular religion or the idea following one itself. As every theme, you can flip this theme showing either a fervent believer who actually is in a sort of crisis or a completely convinced atheist who sees the good side of being a believer. http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisOfFaith
