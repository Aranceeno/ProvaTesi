Directly connected with the fear of Death there's the need to leave a mark on history, something that can outlive the individual himself. Some kind of ideology, action, piece of art or great impact on the world itself. Something able to get to the history books and impact the lives of many generations to come. http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyImmortality
