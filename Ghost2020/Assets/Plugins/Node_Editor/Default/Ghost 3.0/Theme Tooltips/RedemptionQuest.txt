Redemption is difficult to "measure" - by what standard can you establish a certain action needs redemption? Where is the line between reedemed or not? Is "redemption" worth it?

As an example, does saving 1, 10 or 100 lives redeem you for causing a death? http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionQuest
